# nvim
My config for neovim. It tries to:

## Have the features you'd expect
- The IDE-like stuff: autocomplete, rename, hover, go to definition etc. with native LSP
- Better syntax highlighting with treesitter
- Other qol stuff like a proper file browser, some git integration, visual navigation between buffers
- Easy setup for multiple languages
- Also works as a note taking app / non-coding text editor for markdown files

## Keep things as simple as possible
- Use only the absolutely necessary plugins to achieve the aforementioned
- Use the defaults for plugins and for neovim when sensible
- No weird UI / UX shenanigans: nothing pops at your face / hijacks the cursor / gets inserted unless you explicitly choose so

*This config is based on the excellent [neovim from scratch](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch) template*
