# Another neovim config
This is my neovim setup. Its main goal is to be as simple and maintainable as possible so that I can use neovim for other things than configuring neovim.

## It has some features
- The IDE-like stuff: autocomplete, rename, hover, go to definition etc. with native LSP
- Better syntax highlighting with treesitter
- Lightspeed to navigate text fast
- Telescope to navigate files fast
- Other qol stuff like a proper file browser, gitsigns, visual navigation between buffers
- Also works as a note taking app / non-coding text editor for markdown files
- See [plugins.lua](https://github.com/eemilhaa/nvim/blob/main/lua/user/plugins.lua) for a complete list of plugins


*This config is based on the excellent [neovim from scratch](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch) template*
